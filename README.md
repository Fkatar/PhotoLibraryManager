# Practical Work 1 @ DCO-LEI-FCUL

## Overview
This project is part of **Practical Work 1** for the **Object-Oriented Programming** course, within the **DCO-LEI-FCUL** curriculum. The application developed is a **photo manager**, which includes a graphical user interface (GUIClient) and a client program (SimpleClient).

The application allows:
- Viewing the content of the main library and the trash.
- Viewing the content of predefined albums with two clicks.
- Selecting and moving photos into an album.
- Deleting photos and albums.
- Additional functionalities are exercised using the **SimpleClient** program.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, the following prerequisites must be installed:

- **JDK (Java Development Kit)** version 17 or higher (Oracle or OpenJDK).
- **IDE** of your choice (Eclipse is recommended) with the **SonarLint** plugin installed.

### Necessary Installations:
- **JDK 17 Oracle**: [Download here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
- **SWT (Standard Widget Toolkit)**: [Documentation and downloads](https://www.eclipse.org/swt/)
- **JavaXT**: [Documentation and downloads](https://www.javaxt.com)

## How to Use
1. Import the project into Eclipse (or another preferred IDE).
2. Once the implementation is complete, run either **SimpleClient** or **GUIClient**.
   - If you encounter issues compiling or running classes that depend on **SWT**, you can use only **SimpleClient**, which does not rely on the graphical interface.
